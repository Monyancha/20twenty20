<p>As seen on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule">LifeHacker</a> and various other sources, the <em>20-20-20 Rule</em> is a simple guideline to mitigate eye strain for computer users:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The New York Times <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/ask-well-help-for-the-deskbound/?ref=health">later published an updated rule</a> to keep office workers from being desk-bound all day:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every 20 minutes, walk 20 feet away for 20 seconds or more.</p>
</blockquote>

<a id="the-short-answer" class="anchor" href="#the-short-answer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The short answer</h4>

<p>According to the American Optometric Association, <a href="http://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/protecting-your-vision/computer-vision-syndrome?sso=y">Computer Vision Syndrome/Digital Eye Strain</a> (CVS) is a diagnosable medical condition with symptoms such as headaches, dry eyes, and blurred vision. It can be treated by simple adjustments to your computer usage patterns, like following the 20-20-20 Rule.</p>

<p>If you're reading this, you're at risk for CVS, but it's well within your power to do something about it!</p>

<h4>
<a id="the-slightly-longer-answer" class="anchor" href="#the-slightly-longer-answer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Slightly-Longer Answer</h4>

<p>In 2014, internet trends showed people across the world spend hours a day looking at computer screens <em>(source: <a href="http://gizmodo.com/how-much-time-the-world-spends-looking-at-screens-visu-1583114030">Gizmodo</a>)</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/1971/electronic-media-use/" title="Infographic: Americans Use Electronic Media 11+ Hours A Day | Statista"><img src="https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_1971_Electronic_Media_Use_n.jpg" alt="Infographic: Americans Use Electronic Media 11+ Hours A Day | Statista" width="100%" height="auto"></a><br></p>

<p>Most people look at a computer screen today- it's just a part of modern life. Computer Vision Syndrome is one of many health problems that sitting in front of a screen for an extended period of time can cause. Higher digital engagement may stimulate our minds, but it can also make our eyes tired and our bodies mushy. Science has demonstrated for some time that physical inactivity has negative effects on the body, such as an increased risk for some cardiovascular diseases, anxiety and depression, and obesity. </p>

<p>Whether you're working at a computer, playing on your phone, or watching TV, taking short breaks for physical activity can have profound effects on your long-term health. Even adding as little as two minutes of light-intensity exercise (e.g. walking around) every hour <a href="http://nyti.ms/1AW610V">can lower risk of mortality by 33%</a>! The 20-20-20 Rule is an excellent tool to keep you in control of your computer usage rather than the other way around.</p>

<a id="enter-20-twenty-20" class="anchor" href="#enter-20-twenty-20" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Enter 20 twenty 20</h2>

<p>While the 20-20-20 Rule is a simple and powerful guideline, remembering to follow it is easier said than done. For months, I set a manual 20 minute timer, counted 20 seconds while staring morosely at a far wall, and then restarted my timer before realizing I could do better. If I ever missed setting a new timer, I'd sometimes forget to do so for the rest of the day! While there are some programs that manage this through a computer, I couldn't take advantage of them if I was offline watching TV or reading on my tablet.</p>

<p><strong>20 twenty 20</strong> is an Android app that takes care of all of this for you. Since most people have their phones nearby at all times, it avoids the problem of being bound to a desk. Press Play in the app, and it will remind you every 20 minutes to take a break by recommending a light-to-medium intensity exercise. The app will also notify you when your break is done and you can get back to enjoying your computer media a bit more refreshed without having to monitor your break time yourself.</p>

<p>20 twenty 20 is also very flexible; if you only want to be reminded to take a break once every hour, but for ten minutes, that's fine! Or if you want to use a certain special ringtone for your reminders, that works too. You can suspend and resume the 20-20-20 cycle as often as you like, and easily schedule your break and work/play phases.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. Be healthy and happy, and live well!</p>
