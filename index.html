<p>As seen on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule">LifeHacker</a> and various other sources, the <em>20-20-20 Rule</em> is a simple guideline to mitigate eye strain for computer users:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The New York Times <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/ask-well-help-for-the-deskbound/?ref=health">later published an updated rule</a> to keep office workers from being desk-bound all day:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every 20 minutes, walk 20 feet away for 20 seconds or more.</p>
</blockquote>

<a id="why-bother" class="anchor" href="#why-bother" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why bother?</h3>

<p>In 2014, internet trends showed people across the world spend hours a day looking at computer screens <em>(source: <a href="http://gizmodo.com/how-much-time-the-world-spends-looking-at-screens-visu-1583114030">Gizmodo</a>)</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/1971/electronic-media-use/" title="Infographic: Americans Use Electronic Media 11+ Hours A Day | Statista"><img src="https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_1971_Electronic_Media_Use_n.jpg" alt="Infographic: Americans Use Electronic Media 11+ Hours A Day | Statista" width="100%" height="auto"></a><br></p>

<p>Increased digital engagement may stimulate our minds, but it can also make our eyes tired and our bodies mushy. Whether you're working at a computer, playing on your phone, or watching TV, taking short breaks for physical activity can have profound effects on your long-term health. Even adding as little as two minutes of light-intensity exercise (e.g. walking around) every hour <a href="http://nyti.ms/1AW610V">can lower risk of mortality by 33%</a>!</p>

<a id="20-twenty-20" class="anchor" href="#20-twenty-20" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>20 twenty 20</h2>

<p>While the 20-20-20 Rule is a simple and powerful guideline, remembering to follow it is easier said than done. For months, I set a manual 20 minute timer, counted 20 seconds while staring morosely at a far wall, and then restarted my timer before realizing I could do better. If I ever missed setting a new timer, I'd sometimes forget to do so for the rest of the day! While there are some programs that manage this through a computer, I couldn't take advantage of them if I was offline watching TV or reading on my tablet.</p>

<p><strong>20 twenty 20</strong> is an Android app that takes care of this for you. Since most people have their phones nearby at all times, it avoids the problem of being bound to a desk. Press Play in the app, and it will remind you every 20 minutes to take a break by recommending a light-to-medium intensity exercise. The app will also notify you when your break is done and you can get back to enjoying your computer media a bit more refreshed without having to monitor your break time yourself.</p>

<p>20 twenty 20 is also pretty flexible; if you only want to be reminded to take a break every hour, but for five minutes, that's fine! Or if you want to use a certain special notification sound for your reminders, that works too. You can suspend and resume the 20-20-20 cycle as often as you like, and easily schedule your break and work/play phases.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. Be healthy and happy, and live well.</p>
