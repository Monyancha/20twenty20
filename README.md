An Android app to serve notifications for the [20-20-20 Rule](http://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule). Keep yourself healthy with short activity breaks!

20 twenty 20 uses an MVP-based architecture built with Kotlin, Dagger 2, and RxJava, and a host of other open source libraries. Hopefully its source will be as useful to you as the app itself!
