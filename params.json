If you'd like to build it from source, you can grab the code [from GitHub](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/20twenty20). Or, if you'd like to try out a pre-release version, just [send me a message](mailto:20twenty20@itsronald.com).\r\n\r\n## The 20-20-20 Rule\r\nAs seen on [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule) and various other sources, the _20-20-20 Rule_ is a simple guideline to mitigate eye strain for computer users:\r\n\r\n> Every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times [later published an updated rule](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/ask-well-help-for-the-deskbound/?ref=health) to keep office workers from being desk-bound all day:\r\n\r\n> Every 20 minutes, walk 20 feet away for 20 seconds or more.\r\n\r\n### Why bother?\r\n\r\nIn 2014, internet trends showed people across the world spend hours a day looking at computer screens _(source: [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/how-much-time-the-world-spends-looking-at-screens-visu-1583114030))_. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/1971/electronic-media-use/\" title=\"Infographic: Americans Use Electronic Media 11+ Hours A Day | Statista\"><img src=\"https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_1971_Electronic_Media_Use_n.jpg\" alt=\"Infographic: Americans Use Electronic Media 11+ Hours A Day | Statista\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:960px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;\"/></a><br />\r\n\r\nIncreased digital engagement may stimulate our minds, but it can also make our eyes tired and our bodies mushy. Whether you're working at a computer, playing on your phone, or watching TV, taking short breaks for physical activity can have profound effects on your long-term health. Even adding as little as two minutes of light-intensity exercise (e.g. walking around) every hour [can lower risk of mortality by 33%](http://nyti.ms/1AW610V)!\r\n\r\n## 20 twenty 20\r\n\r\nWhile the 20-20-20 Rule is a simple and powerful guideline, remembering to follow it is easier said than done. For months, I set a manual 20 minute timer, counted 20 seconds while staring morosely at a far wall, and then restarted my timer before realizing I could do better. If I ever missed setting a new timer, I'd sometimes forget to do so for the rest of the day! While there are some programs that manage this through a computer, I couldn't take advantage of them if I was offline watching TV or reading on my tablet.\r\n\r\n**20 twenty 20** is an Android app that takes care of this for you. Since most people have their phones nearby at all times, it avoids the problem of being bound to a desk. Press Play in the app, and it will remind you every 20 minutes to take a break by recommending a light-to-medium intensity exercise. The app will also notify you when your break is done and you can get back to enjoying your computer media a bit more refreshed without having to monitor your break time yourself.\r\n\r\n**20 twenty 20** is also pretty flexible; if you only want to be reminded to take a break every hour, but for five minutes, that's fine! Or if you want to use a certain special sound for your reminders, that works too. You can suspend and resume the 20-20-20 cycle as often as you like, and easily skip or restart your break and work/play phases.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. Be healthy and happy, and live well.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nFeel free to [shoot me a message](mailto:20twenty20@itsronald.com) with any questions.",
